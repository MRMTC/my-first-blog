			{# The two perecentage signs notation means that we are using Django template tags.  This time we will use one that will create a URL for us. 'blog' is the name of our application (the directory blog), 'views' is from the name of the views.py file and the last bit 'post_detail' is the name of the 'view'. 'pk' is short for primary key, which is a unique name for each record in a database #}
